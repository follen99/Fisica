# Summary of [F1 - Lezione 11 - Forza di gravità](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw)

### [00:00:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=0) - [01:00:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=3600)

The video discusses the concept of the principle of inertia and its limits in different scenarios. The video explains Galileo's principle of relativity, which established that there is no privileged direction in the world, and it applies to all possible observers. However, the video also explores how the principle of inertia has limitations when considering non-inertial reference frames, such as those in accelerating systems. The use of centrifugal and Coriolis forces is introduced as a way to account for this. The speaker also notes the importance of identifying all the possible forces acting on an object to classify a reference system as inertial. Additionally, the speaker discusses the difference between local and global effects of gravity and their impact on the classification of a reference system as inertial or non-inertial.

- **[00:00:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=0)** In this section, the instructor discusses the limits of the principles of dynamics, particularly the first principle which states that a body with no external forces acting upon it or with balanced forces will maintain constant velocity. He explains that a body can either remain stationary or move in a straight line if there are no forces acting on it. The discussion is done with the help of a slide presentation and involves 50 participants.
- **[00:05:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=300)** In this section, the concept of the principle of inertia is evaluated in relation to all possible observers and reference systems. The discussion starts with Galileo's principle of relativity, which established that two laboratories moving relative to each other at a constant velocity have no experiment that can give different results in either laboratory. The principle of relativity, which was later used extensively by Einstein in his theory of relativity, was tested using the example of two observers named Pasquale and Giuseppina who were placed inside two closed ships without any view of the outside but equipped with scientific instruments.
- **[00:10:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=600)** In this section, the lesson discusses the concept of the principle of relativity as expressed by Galileo. To explain this concept, an example is given where two individuals conduct experiments on their ships. They perform 20,000 experiments to determine which of them is moving and which one is stationary, but the results are the same. Galileo's example is cited to illustrate that there is no privileged direction in the world.
- **[00:15:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=900)** In this section, the video explains that Galileo observed that objects move with equal velocities in every direction and that no matter how fast something is moving in a straight line, its movement will remain uniform. The concept of inertia applies to all possible observers, and thus, the principle of everything that happens to an observer at rest happens the same way to the observer moving in a straight line with a constant velocity. This is known as the principle of relativity, and both systems of reference and observers obey it.
- **[00:20:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=1200)** In this section of the video, the concept of the principle of inertia is further explored by considering how it applies in a scenario where a train undergoes accelerated motion, as opposed to uniform motion. Objects in the train compartment experience a force when the train either accelerates or brakes suddenly, causing them to be thrown forward or backward. However, when no external force is present, the principle of inertia dictates that there should be no acceleration of the objects. Thus, in the absence of an external force, an individual in a train compartment can either remain motionless or experience an acceleration in the same direction as the train's movement.
- **[00:25:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=1500)** In this section, the speaker discusses the limitations of the principle of inertia for observers who are in accelerated motion, such as those on a train that accelerates or brakes. This leads to the division of the world into two parts: inertial systems where the principle of inertia holds, and non-inertial systems where it does not. To salvage the theory of Newton for non-inertial systems, additional forces must be introduced, such as the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force, which only appear in non-inertial systems. By introducing these extra forces, the theory can still be applied, and the speaker promises to explore this idea in more detail in the following lectures.
- **[00:30:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=1800)** In this section, the speaker discusses the challenges of applying Newton's law of motion to non-inertial reference frames, such as those in accelerating systems. The use of fictitious forces is introduced as a way to account for this problem, but further issues arise when considering the motion of objects in reference frames that are not truly stationary. The example of an observer on Earth is used to illustrate this, as the rotation of the planet means that even the observer on land is technically in an accelerating system. The speaker suggests using the Sun or the center of the galaxy as a reference instead, but even those reference frames are accelerating in various ways, making the use of a truly inertial reference frame impossible.
- **[00:35:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=2100)** In this section, the video discusses how in the entire universe, there is not a single inertial system, which poses a challenge to Newton's theories. Newton introduces the idea of absolute space, which he posits exists and remains immobile. However, Einstein comes along 300 years later and upends this idea, stating that space and time are relative to observers, effectively invalidating Newton's assumptions. However, the video suggests that an approximation could be made to save the situation, as Galileo proposed with his "cow" theory.
- **[00:40:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=2400)** In this section, the professor teaches the audience about the difference between local and global effects of gravity. If an observer is in a small area around a station, then the effects of the Earth's rotation can be considered negligible, and they can be treated as an inertial observer. However, if an observer looks at the situation globally, then the effects of rotation cannot be neglected. This is a simplification of reality, as Galileo taught us that complexity should be taken out of the equation to understand physics. Though the lecture gets technical, the professor simplifies the discussion for the audience to grasp the concept.
- **[00:45:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=2700)** In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of identifying all the possible forces acting on an object in order to classify a reference system as inertial. He explains that in an inertial system, one can always identify the body responsible for each force. However, if an acceleration is observed without a corresponding force, then the reference system is non-inertial. The speaker uses the example of feeling pushed forward on a train accelerating to illustrate this point. He concludes by stating that they will take a five-minute break before moving on to the next topic.

In this lecture, the speaker discusses the concept of gravity, its formulas, and its applications in physics. He explains the principles of dynamics and the existence of inertial systems, where the force of gravity applies. The lecturer prioritizes the new theory of gravitation that comes from Einstein's General Theory of Relativity instead of the old celestial mechanics of Kepler and Newton, while showing the formula for gravitational force, as well as its vector form. He also distinguishes between weight and mass and talks about the constant of universal gravity, which was first measured by Cavendish. Finally, he discusses the concept of fundamental constants of nature, such as the force of gravity, and their impact on the emergence of life.

- **[01:00:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=3600)** In this section, the speaker introduces a new slide while giving his students a short break. The slide being introduced shows the force of gravity, a fundamental concept in physics. He encourages the students to take a look at the new slide while he takes a short break.
- **[01:05:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=3900)** In this section, the instructor discusses the principles of dynamics and the existence of inertial systems where those principles apply. The lecture focuses on real forces that exist in initial systems, such as gravity, which he explains in detail. The speaker also touches on changes in the physics curriculum in universities, where a two-year program has now been condensed to one, requiring educators to select the most significant topics to teach effectively.
- **[01:10:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=4200)** In this section, the lecturer talks about his choice to prioritize the new theory of gravitation that comes from Einstein's General Theory of Relativity instead of the old celestial mechanics of Kepler and Newton. He explains that he would rather talk about the Principle of Equivalence and how it forms the basis of the new theory of gravitation. The formula for gravitational force is discussed, which says that it is proportional to the product of two masses and inversely proportional to the distance between their centers squared. The formula is also shown in vector form, and the lecturer emphasizes that it applies to any pair of masses, not just the sun and a planet.
- **[01:15:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=4500)** In this section, the speaker explains the direction and sign of the gravitational force between two objects based on Newton's law. He clarifies that the negative sign indicates an attractive force, whereas the positive sign would denote a repulsive force, which does not occur in gravity. He also emphasizes the usefulness of this formula for making predictions about celestial bodies' orbits, such as determining the next eclipse, and highlights its power as a tool for scientific understanding.
- **[01:20:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=4800)** In this section, the lecturer explains how the force of gravity can be calculated when a small mass is on the surface of the Earth, using the formula for gravity with the mass and radius of the Earth. The force of gravity calculated in this manner is referred to as the force of weight, and the acceleration of gravity on the Earth's surface is equal to g. The theory of Newton allows for the prediction of the acceleration of gravity on Earth, allowing for calculation without experimentation using the formula provided by the lecturer.
- **[01:25:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=5100)** In this section, the video discusses how to measure the acceleration of gravity through a simple experiment using a pendulum. The period of the pendulum depends on the acceleration of gravity, and by measuring the number of oscillations and using the inverse formula of the period of time, one can experimentally determine the value of gravity. However, the theory allows for the prediction of this value independently of the experiment. The lesson also touches on the constant of universal gravity and the difference between weight and mass, with weight being a force while mass is a scalar.
- **[01:30:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=5400)** In this section, the speaker explains the difference between mass and weight, where weight is a vector quantity and mass is a scalar quantity; weight is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration due to gravity. The speaker then moves on to explain the constant term G in the gravitational force equation (F = Gm1m2/r^2). They illustrate an example where m1 and m2 are both equal to 1 kg and r is equal to 1 meter, which results in a value of F equal to G.
- **[01:35:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=5700)** In this section, the video discusses gravity and the force it exerts on objects. The force of gravity on an object is equal to G, which is the force with which one unit of mass attracts another unit of mass at a distance of one meter. This force is very small, with a value of 10^-11, allowing objects to remain separate rather than attract each other together. The number 6.67 x 10^-11 is known as the constant of universal gravitation and was first measured by Cavendish in 1798 using a precision balance.
- **[01:40:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=6000)** In this section, the professor discusses whether or not a formula can be used to predict the number for gravity. The formula for gravity has already been determined to be 6.67 x 10^-11, but the question posed is whether this number can be predicted using a theory instead of experimentation. The answer is no - there is no theory to predict this number, including Einstein's theory of relativity, which also required experimentation to determine the value.
- **[01:45:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=6300)** In this section, the lecturer discusses the concept of fundamental constants of nature, such as the force of gravity, the speed of light, the mass of electrons and protons, and Planck's constant. He explains that these constants are considered fundamental because there is currently no explanation for why they have the values they do, and there is no way to predict them theoretically. He challenges his audience to think about the problem and come up with a solution, reminding them that finding an answer could potentially win them the Nobel Prize.
- **[01:50:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=6600)** In this section, the speaker discusses the concept of changing the value of the universal gravitational constant to illustrate its impact on the formation of the universe. If the value were larger, the universe would have collapsed before galaxies could form, and if smaller, the particles would have expanded, but there wouldn't be any stars or galaxies. The speaker mentions a book by the late scientist, Stephen Hawking, who stated that these fundamental numbers seemed to be coordinated perfectly to make the emergence of life possible.
- **[01:55:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=6900)** In this section, the speaker explains the relationship between stars and the creation of heavy metals. When a star dies and explodes, heavy metals such as carbon and iron are created, which are essential building blocks for life. Humans are comprised of the second generation of stars, born from the explosions of earlier stars. The speaker then poses a thought-provoking theory that if the charge of electrons were slightly different, life as we know it would not exist.

### [02:00:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=7200) - [02:40:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=9600)

This video discusses three possible ways to explain the fundamental constants of nature that have allowed life to develop: chance, multiverse theory, or intelligent design. The video then focuses on the definition of mass and introduces the concept of gravitational mass, which is defined as the ability of a body to attract or be attracted by another body through the force of gravity. The speaker also discusses the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass and proves it using the "hammer and feather" experiment conducted by astronaut David Scott during the Apollo 15 mission. The speaker then introduces Einstein's theory of general relativity, which builds on Galileo's experiment and introduces the concept that mass causes space-time to curve. The lesson ends with a Q&A and the announcement of the next remote session.

- **[02:05:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=7500)** In this section, the speaker discusses the three possible ways to answer the question about the precise numbers that appear to have made life possible. The first possibility is that it was purely a matter of chance that the numbers turned out that way, with the probability being very small, similar to a monkey randomly typing out the entire Divine Comedy. The second possibility is that there is some sort of multiverse theory, with our universe being one out of many, and we just happen to be in the one that has the right conditions for life. The third possibility is that there is some sort of intelligent design, with a creator who deliberately set the right conditions for life to emerge.
- **[02:10:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=7800)** In this section, the speaker discusses the three main possibilities for explaining the fundamental constants of nature that have allowed life to develop, including the Catholic version that posits the existence of a Creator who ordered and set things in motion, a version that scientists may feel uneasy about. The second possibility, as outlined by the speaker, is that there exist infinite universes with different combinations of fundamental constants, and ours happens to be one that has just the right combination. The third possibility, also posited by scientists, is that there are infinite universes with different combinations of fundamental constants, and some may be habitable while others are not. The speaker notes that none of these can be experimentally proven and that belief in any of these possibilities is left to an individual's personal choice due to a lack of concrete evidence.
- **[02:15:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=8100)** In this section, the video discusses the issue of determining fundamental universes and who has the right to decide on them, which poses a problem. The discussion moves on to the problem of mass, which is the other factor in the formula for gravity besides the gravitational constant. The video points out that relying on the current definition of mass that has been given, which is the inertial mass, is insufficient, and additional definitions must be established to account for cases where two masses act in opposite directions.
- **[02:20:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=8400)** In this section, the concept of gravitational mass is discussed, and how it differs from inertial mass. Gravitational mass is defined as the ability of a body to attract or be attracted by another body through the force of gravity. It is an active concept, as opposed to the passive nature of inertial mass. The two concepts are shown to be equivalent, although the definitions and methods of measurement are initially very different.
- **[02:25:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=8700)** In this section, the video discusses the measurement of gravitational mass and how it is equivalent to inertial mass as a direct consequence of the theory of gravitation. The video then shows a clip of the Apollo 15 mission and the famous "hammer and feather" experiment performed by astronaut David Scott on the surface of the moon to demonstrate that objects of different masses fall at the same rate in a vacuum, thereby verifying the theories of Galileo and Newton.
- **[02:30:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=9000)** In this section, the instructor discusses an experiment conducted by astronaut David Scott during the Apollo 15 mission, where he drops a hammer and a feather on the moon, proving Galileo's theory that objects will fall at the same rate in a vacuum. This is strange because unlike the electric force, gravity pulls all objects, regardless of mass, in the same way. Einstein later used this experiment as the basis for his theory of general relativity, which is different from Newton's theory, as it introduces the concept that mass causes space-time to curve.
- **[02:35:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=9300)** In this section, the speaker discusses the general theory of relativity by Einstein, which is based on Galileo's experiment. Einstein builds on the experiment by introducing the principle of equivalence, which we will look into next time. The discussion also touched on the principle of inertia's limitations, the importance of the gravitational force in predicting things, the problems with the universal gravitational constant, and the definition of gravitational mass. The speaker mentions the significance of Galileo's experiment in demonstrating the equivalence of initial and gravitational mass, and how they will explore it further in the next lesson. Ultimately, the lesson highlights the importance of going through each concept and limit one at a time.
- **[02:40:00](https://youtu.be/u9QVpENGUBw?t=9600)** In this section, the speaker ends the lesson and asks if there are any questions, to which there are none except for one. The speaker then concludes the session and mentions that the next lesson will be held remotely on Friday.
