The concept of time and how it has been defined throughout history is explored in this YouTube video. The video explains Aristotle and Lucretius' definition of time as connected to movement, as well as Newton's definition of time as a species of number that quantifies movement. The video also delves into the difficulty in defining time precisely and argues that the focus should be on how we measure it instead. The lecturer provides an operational definition of time, including the current definition based on the oscillations of an atom. Furthermore, the principles of dynamics, as outlined by Newton, are discussed, explaining how force and velocity are interconnected. The importance of not relying solely on intuition and observation in physics is also highlighted.

The speaker also recommends a book on the history of time by physicist Paul Davis. The definition of time given by Aristotle and Lucretius is that time is connected to movement. The speaker then presents Newton's definition of time as a species of number that quantifies movement. This lays the foundation for the study of dynamics, which will be the topic of the next section.
- **[00:05:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=300)** In this section of the video, the teacher discusses Newton's concept of absolute space and time, which he believed existed independently of external relations and flowed uniformly without being connected to the movement of things. The teacher highlights that with Newton, time became a measurable quantity expressed in numbers, like other physical quantities. Despite this, the teacher emphasizes that time and space are not things humans created, but rather two objective elements that are innate in the physical laws of the universe. These objective elements can be discovered, but the mathematical methods used to describe them are man-made.
- **[00:10:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=600)** In this section, the video discusses the difficulty in defining time for physicists and how Galileo's teachings come into play. Galileo believed that sometimes it's not important to understand the essence of things and that trying to do so is too difficult. Instead, Galileo suggested that physicists should focus on measurable aspects of reality, such as magnitude, capacity, and mutability, which are derivable in quantity and measurable. Galileo's opinion was that there are situations where giving time a definition, as Aristotle had intended with proximate genre and specific difference, is impossible and a futile endeavor.
- **[00:15:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=900)** In this section, the concept of the electron is explored, with the idea being that it is not definitively known if it is a wave or a particle as it demonstrates characteristics of both. It is acknowledged that the electron cannot be contained within the mental schematics of just one of these categories, as it is not entirely defined by wave-like or particle-like characteristics. However, this lack of understanding does not mean the field of physics is at a standstill. Rather, much has been achieved through the exploration of the electron's measurable properties, such as its mass, energy, and angular momentum. Similarly, other objects such as the photon, while we might not fully understand its nature, are still useful to us because they exhibit measurable properties. Ultimately, this understanding opens up the possibility for technological advancement, even if the fundamental essence of some objects remains a mystery.
- **[00:20:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=1200)** In this section, the video discusses the concept of time and how it is difficult to define it precisely. Physicist Richard Feynman's definition of time is taken from his book "The Feynman Lectures" where he says that time is what happens when nothing else does. However, this definition doesn't help us to measure time accurately. The video argues that while we may not be able to define time with precision, what's more important is how we measure time. The video concludes by stating that not being able to give a complete definition of something doesn't prevent scientists from investigating and measuring it.
- **[00:25:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=1500)** In this section, the lecturer explains that instead of asking "What is time?", we should ask "How do we measure time?" to obtain an operational definition of what time actually is. The lecturer explains that an operational definition consists of the way we measure a physical quantity to obtain a precise definition. The unit of measurement for time, the second, was once defined by the rotation of the Earth, but technological advances led to the current definition of time based on the oscillations of an atom. The current definition is precise to the thirteenth decimal place, making the error practically nonexistent.
- **[00:30:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=1800)** In this section, the video discusses the transition of cesium atoms and why it is important to understand. The state of cesium in its ground state, specifically in the 2S state, is stable and has a certain number of oscillations based on quantum mechanics. Although certain fundamental quantities of physics cannot be restricted or defined, the definition and operational definition can be used to measure them. The video then moves on to the topic of dynamics, which is the part of physics that connects the causes of motion to the effects of the world.
- **[00:35:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=2100)** In this section, the speaker discusses the principles of dynamics as put forth by Newton in 1687. Newton, much like Euclid did for geometry, built his theory of dynamics based on previous work, particularly that of Galileo. He starts with three initial postulates and derives subsequent theorems from those. Although the principles are not provable, they are treated as axiomatic, and any theory based on those principles needs to be consistent with experimental evidence. The speaker recommends a book by Albert Einstein and Leopold Infeld called "The Evolution of Physics" as a good supplement to learn more about the principles of dynamics.
- **[00:40:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=2400)** In this section, the video discusses the principles of dynamics and how it relates to force and velocity. While Einstein described the principles of dynamics in the 1930s with examples such as a steam engine or a horse, the concept still holds true today. Our intuitive idea is that the force applied to an object determines its velocity. However, Aristotle believed that a body stops when the force applied to it is no longer able to push it further. If Aristotle had written an equation for this concept, it would be that force is proportional to velocity. Galileo's discovery of the scientific method was the true beginning of physics, as it showed that not everything can be trusted without proof or experimentation.
- **[00:45:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=2700)** In this section, the speaker discusses how intuitive conclusions based on immediate observation can lead individuals astray. They give the example that people used to believe that the sun rotated around the Earth, but in reality, it is the Earth that rotates around the sun. Additionally, individuals used to believe that the force is proportional to velocity, but rather, it is proportional to acceleration. Ultimately, these examples demonstrate the importance of not relying solely on intuition and observation, which can sometimes be misleading. The speaker then introduces Galileo's three principles of dynamics and notes that the first principle is another example of Galileo's contributions.

This section of the F1 lecture series covers the principles of inertia and Newton's laws of motion. The first principle of inertia, established by Galileo, states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion moves at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. Newton's second law introduces the concept of force as the cause of acceleration and its relationship to inertia, with acceleration being proportional to the force rather than velocity. The third principle of action is also discussed, stating that forces on two different bodies are equal and opposite but do not cancel out because they act on different bodies. The lecture concludes with a discussion of how to measure the inertial mass of an object using a dynamometer.

- **[01:00:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=3600)** In this section, the instructor introduces the first principle of inertia, which was established by Galileo Galilei and became the foundation of the theory of dynamics. The instructor promises to further explain Einstein's take on the principle, but for now, they simply explain that inertia relies on the fundamental idea that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force.
- **[01:05:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=3900)** In this section, the instructor discusses the concepts of "principle of inertia" and "uniform linear motion." The principle of inertia, introduced by Galileo, states that an object not affected by external forces will maintain a consistent velocity, whether at rest or in motion, until a force is applied to it. Galileo's insight was a significant development, as he recognized that uniform motion could occur without any cause. The instructor uses the example of a person in a supermarket pushing a cart with wheels and a little bit of oil, illustrating how motion without any force could theoretically happen, given ideal circumstances such as a frictionless surface like ice. Although it's impossible to eliminate all forces and friction in real life, Galileo's principle of inertia and his approach of focusing only on necessary factors when building models remain influential in physics today.
- **[01:10:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=4200)** In this section, the discussion revolves around Galileo's experiments on motion and the concept of inertia. Galileo eliminated all possible causes of friction in his mind and built a model where friction didn't exist. Therefore, the car would continue to move indefinitely with no other force acting upon it. Einstein stated that the most significant aspect of Galileo's discovery was the assertion that uniform motion could exist independently of any other cause. Therefore, the motion would continue indefinitely, with no external force after the initial push.
- **[01:15:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=4500)** In this section, the concept of the principle of inertia as described by Galileo is discussed. Galileo stated that any particle in motion will remain at a constant velocity unless acted upon by external forces, and this condition only occurs on horizontal planes. Galileo's insight forms the first principle of dynamics. Furthermore, the definition of force is introduced as the cause of acceleration, and it is stated that any accelerated motion is typically related to the presence of external forces.
- **[01:20:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=4800)** In this section, the instructor defines force and its relation to acceleration through examples of accelerated motion. The definition of force is identified as a cause of acceleration which can also cause deformation in static situations. The concept of force is relevant in dynamic situations where acceleration is present and in static situations where deformation occurs. The second principle of Newton, also known as the law of acceleration, is introduced and states that force is proportional to acceleration, rather than velocity. The larger the force, the greater the acceleration, according to this law.
- **[01:25:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=5100)** In this section, the lecturer discusses the relationship between force and acceleration in accordance with Newton's second law. He explains that acceleration is a vector, and therefore, force must also be a vector. He gives an example of an experiment with ropes and pulleys to show that the forces of the ropes follow the parallelogram rule. He also asserts that this law is a fundamental principle that is not based on any other law, and there is no demonstration for it. Instead, Newton arrived at this relationship through observation and experimentation.
- **[01:30:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=5400)** In this section, the concept of the mass and the constant of proportionality (previously called "tappa") are discussed. The constant of proportionality is now called "m" and is known as the inertial mass. The inertial mass is defined as the ability of a body to resist changes in motion, and it is measured by dividing the force applied to an object by its resulting acceleration. It is important to note that the inertial mass cannot be measured with a scale, but rather through experimentation. Additional details on the gravitational mass will be covered in the next lesson.
- **[01:35:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=5700)** In this section, the professor explains how to measure forces and mass using a spring scale called a dynamometer. He explains that forces are measured in newtons and are proportional to acceleration and deformation. He also illustrates how to measure the mass of an object using the force of 2 newtons and acceleration of 5 meters per second squared. The professor concludes that the discussion on the first and second principles will continue in the next lecture to explore when they work and when they don't.
- **[01:40:00](https://youtu.be/OeqAYvMDkbc?t=6000)** In this section, the speaker discusses the third principle of action in relation to the force exerted on two different bodies. The force on one body is equal and opposite to that on the other. However, the two forces do not cancel out because they act on different bodies. The speaker likens this to punching someone, where the force exerted on the recipient is equal and opposite to that exerted by them, but both experience the impact. The principle of action applies to different bodies and does not result in a cancellation of forces.
